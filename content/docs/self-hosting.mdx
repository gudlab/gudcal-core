title: Self-Hosting
description: Deploy GudCal on your own infrastructure.
---

GudCal is designed to be self-hosted. Run it on your own server, VPS, or container platform with full control over your data.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.17 or later
- **PostgreSQL** 14 or later (Neon, Supabase, or self-hosted)
- **pnpm** package manager

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavewebs/gudcal.git
cd gudcal
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Copy the environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Set up the database:

```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
```

5. Start the application:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Environment Variables

These are the required environment variables for self-hosting:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Random secret for session encryption |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Your deployment URL (e.g. `https://cal.example.com`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Same as NEXTAUTH_URL |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 32-byte hex key for encrypting calendar tokens |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | For sending email notifications |
| `STRIPE_*` | For billing (not needed for self-hosted free usage) |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID` | For Google Calendar integration |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` | For Google Calendar integration |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Secret for the reminder cron endpoint |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_SELF_HOSTED` | Set to `true` to disable cloud-only features |

## Self-Hosted vs Cloud

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_SELF_HOSTED=true`, the following features are disabled:

- Analytics dashboard
- MCP server (Team plan feature)
- AI features
- Custom domains

All core scheduling features work identically in both modes.

## Generating an Encryption Key

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Reverse Proxy

If you run GudCal behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.), make sure to:

- Forward the `Host` header
- Set `X-Forwarded-Proto` to `https`
- Set `X-Forwarded-For` to the client IP
- Configure WebSocket passthrough if needed
