Blog posts can have multiple categories, authors and related posts.

## Authors

### Create one author

Blog posts can have **one or multiple authors**. <br /> Add a new object with **name, image url and twitter handle** to add a new author to your blog.

```ts title="config/blog.ts" {7-11}
export const BLOG_AUTHORS = {
  timchosen: {
    name: "timchosen",
    image: "/_static/avatars/timchosen.png",
    twitter: "timchosen",
  },
  newauthor: {
    name: "New Author",
    image: "/_static/avatars/newauthor.png",
    twitter: "newauthor",
  },
};
```

### Add in a blog post

Add your new author in your blog post like that :

```mdx {6-8}
---
title: Why We Built GudCal
description: The story behind building open-source scheduling infrastructure.

  - server-client-components
  - preview-mode-headless-cms

```

## Categories

  slug: "news" | "education";
  description: string;
}[] = [
  {
    title: "News",
    slug: "news",
    description: "Updates and announcements from GudCal.",
  },
  {
    title: "Education",
    slug: "education",
    description: "Educational content about scheduling and productivity.",
  },
];
```
