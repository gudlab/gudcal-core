description: How to configure your PostgreSQL database with Neon.
---

GudCal uses **PostgreSQL** as its database, hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/) with Prisma as the ORM. Neon offers a generous free tier that works well for development and small deployments.

Check their [pricing page](https://neon.tech/pricing) for more information.

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create Neon account

If you don't have a Neon account, follow their steps [here](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up) to create one.

### Copy database URL

After creating a project on Neon, copy the database URL. Select `Prisma` from the connection type list, then the `env` tab.

Paste in your `.env` file:

```js
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname";
```

### Generate Prisma client and push migrations

Generate the Prisma client and push the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
```
