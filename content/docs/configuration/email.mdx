  GudCal uses Resend for transactional emails including magic-link login, booking confirmations, and password reset flows.
</Callout>

## Steps

<Callout type="note">
  The email configuration follows the [Resend](https://resend.com/) documentation.
  You can also refer to the official Auth.js docs
  [here](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation#setup-environment) for more details.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create an account

If you don't have an account on Resend, sign up [here](https://resend.com/signup).

### Create an API key

After signing in to Resend, create your first API key.

Copy/paste it in your `.env` file:

```js
RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_resend_api_key;
```

### Configure sender domain

For production, add and verify your domain in Resend to send emails from your own address (e.g. `notifications@gudcal.com`).

</Steps>
