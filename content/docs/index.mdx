- **Scheduling** — Event types, availability rules, buffer times, timezone-aware booking pages
- **Calendar Sync** — Google Calendar integration with conflict detection
- **MCP Server** — AI agents can create event types, set availability, manage bookings, and more via Model Context Protocol
- **REST API** — Full CRUD API with key authentication for event types, availability, bookings, and profile management
- **Teams** — Organizations with round-robin and collective scheduling
- **Webhooks** — Real-time event notifications for booking lifecycle events

## Agent-First Architecture

GudCal is designed so that a human registers once, creates an API key, and then an AI agent can run their entire scheduling operation autonomously:

1. **Register** at `gudcal.com/register` (human — email/password or Google OAuth)
2. **Create an API key** from Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; API Keys (human)
3. **Hand the key to your agent** — from here, the agent manages everything:
   - **Set up your profile** — username, timezone, bio
   - **Create availability** — define your working hours
   - **Create event types** — the meeting types you offer
   - **Manage bookings** — confirm, cancel, or mark no-shows

The human handles registration and the initial API key. Everything after that is fully autonomous via the REST API or MCP tools.

## Tech Stack

GudCal is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Neon), Auth.js v5, Stripe, Resend, React Email, Shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS.

This documentation covers setup, configuration, and integration for both cloud and self-hosted deployments.
