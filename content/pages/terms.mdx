These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of GudCal ("the Service"), operated by GudCal ("we", "us", or "our"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## Account Responsibilities

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You must provide accurate information when creating an account. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any unlawful purpose
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts or data
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service infrastructure
- Use automated tools to create bookings in bad faith or to spam other users
- Resell access to the Service without authorization
- Upload malicious content or attempt to exploit vulnerabilities

## Service Availability

We strive to maintain high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Service may be temporarily unavailable for maintenance, updates, or due to factors beyond our control. We will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of planned downtime.

## Subscriptions and Billing

Paid plans are billed monthly or yearly through Stripe. You may cancel your subscription at any time from the Dashboard. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis.

## Free Tier

The free tier includes limited features as described on the Pricing page. We reserve the right to modify free tier limits with reasonable notice.

## Intellectual Property

The GudCal platform is open source under the GPL-3.0 license. Content you create (event types, booking data, etc.) remains yours. By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to process your content solely for providing the Service.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, GudCal shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use of the Service. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. You may delete your account at any time from the Dashboard Settings page. Upon termination, your data will be deleted in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

## Self-Hosted Instances

These Terms apply to the cloud-hosted version of GudCal. Self-hosted instances are governed by the GPL-3.0 license and any terms you establish for your own deployment.

## Changes

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We will notify you of material changes.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which GudCal operates, without regard to conflict of law principles.
