Calendly is a great product. It practically invented the modern scheduling link and has helped millions of people book meetings without the back-and-forth emails. We respect what they've built.

But the world has changed since Calendly launched. AI agents are scheduling meetings, developers need API-first tools, and many teams want control over their data. That's where GudCal comes in.

## Where Calendly Excels

Let's give credit where it's due:

- **Polish and UX** — Calendly's booking experience is smooth and professional
- **Enterprise features** — SSO, admin controls, and compliance certifications
- **Integrations ecosystem** — hundreds of native integrations with major platforms
- **Routing forms** — sophisticated lead qualification and distribution

If you're a sales team at a large enterprise, Calendly is a solid choice.

## Where GudCal Stands Out

### Open Source and Self-Hostable

GudCal's entire codebase is open source under GPL-3.0. Deploy on your own infrastructure, audit the code, and modify it to fit your needs. No vendor lock-in, no data leaving your servers.

### AI Agent Integration via MCP

This is GudCal's defining feature. The built-in MCP server lets any AI agent — Claude, GPT, or custom models — discover availability and book meetings through a standardized protocol. Calendly's API requires custom integration work for every AI workflow.

### Developer-First Design

Every feature in GudCal works through both the UI and the API. Webhooks fire on every booking event. TypeScript throughout. The codebase is clean and extensible.

### Generous Free Tier

GudCal's free tier includes 3 event types, unlimited bookings, and calendar sync. No per-seat charges for basic usage.

### Modern Tech Stack

Built with Next.js 16, React 19, Prisma 7, and Tailwind CSS 4. If you're a developer, you can read and contribute to the codebase.

## Making the Switch

GudCal supports importing your event types and configuring availability rules to match your existing setup. The booking page URLs work similarly — share your `gudcal.com/username` link and guests can pick a time.

## The Bottom Line

Calendly is excellent for non-technical teams who need a polished, enterprise-ready scheduling tool. GudCal is built for developers, AI-first teams, and anyone who wants open-source scheduling they can own and customize.
