One of GudCal's core promises is that you can run it anywhere. No vendor lock-in, no data leaving your infrastructure. Here's how to get GudCal running on your own server in under 30 minutes.

## Why Self-Host?

There are solid reasons to run your own scheduling platform:

- **Data sovereignty** — booking data, guest information, and calendar tokens never leave your infrastructure
- **Compliance** — meet GDPR, HIPAA, or internal data residency requirements
- **Customization** — modify the source code to fit your exact needs
- **Cost control** — no per-seat pricing for your team

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A server or VPS (2GB RAM minimum)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (or a hosted service like Neon or Supabase)
- Node.js 18.17+ or Docker
- A domain with HTTPS configured

## Method 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavewebs/gudcal.git
cd gudcal
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your database URL, authentication secrets, and other configuration. Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

GudCal will be available on port 3000. Point your reverse proxy at it and you're live.

## Method 2: Manual Deployment

For more control over the build process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavewebs/gudcal.git
cd gudcal
pnpm install
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Essential Configuration

At minimum, you need these environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Random 32+ character secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Your public URL |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth (for login) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth secret |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Email notifications |

## Calendar Integration

To enable Google Calendar sync, you'll need separate OAuth credentials with calendar scopes. Set `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment.

## Keeping Updated

GudCal follows semantic versioning. To update:

```bash
git pull origin main
pnpm install
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
pnpm build
```

Check the changelog before upgrading — we note any breaking changes or migration steps.
