The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is changing how AI agents interact with external tools. At GudCal, we've built MCP support directly into the platform, enabling any compatible AI agent to handle scheduling autonomously.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open standard that lets AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources. Think of it as a universal adapter between language models and the services they need to interact with.

Instead of building custom API integrations for every scheduling platform, an AI agent can use MCP to discover what tools are available and use them through a standardized interface.

## How GudCal's MCP Server Works

GudCal exposes five MCP tools that cover the complete scheduling workflow:

### 1. Discover Event Types

The agent calls `list_event_types` to see what meeting types a user offers — "30 Minute Call", "Technical Interview", "Product Demo", etc.

### 2. Check Availability

Using `get_availability`, the agent retrieves open time slots for a specific event type, respecting the host's availability rules, buffer times, and existing calendar events.

### 3. Create a Booking

The agent calls `create_booking` with the guest's details and selected time. GudCal handles conflict checking, confirmation emails, and calendar event creation automatically.

### 4. Cancel or Reschedule

If plans change, the agent can cancel bookings with `cancel_booking`, optionally providing a reason that gets included in the notification email.

### 5. View Existing Bookings

Authenticated agents can call `get_bookings` to retrieve upcoming, past, or cancelled bookings for the user.

## A Real-World Example

Imagine you're building a customer support AI. A customer says "I need to schedule a call with your team this week." The AI agent can:

1. Call `list_event_types` to find the "Support Call" event type
2. Call `get_availability` to find open slots this week
3. Present the options to the customer
4. Call `create_booking` once the customer picks a time

The entire flow happens in seconds, with no human coordinator involved.

## Getting Started

GudCal's MCP server is available at `/api/mcp` on any GudCal instance. Public tools work without authentication — perfect for booking flows. Private tools require an API key for accessing user-specific data.

Check out our [MCP documentation](/docs/mcp) for the full reference and integration examples.
